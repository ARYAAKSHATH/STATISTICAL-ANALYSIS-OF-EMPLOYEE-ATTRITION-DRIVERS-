# Statistical Analysis of Employee Attrition

## üìå Project Objective
This project performs a comprehensive statistical analysis on the **IBM HR Attrition dataset** to identify the key factors that drive employee turnover.  
The goal is to move beyond anecdotal evidence and provide **data-driven insights** that can inform targeted employee retention strategies.

---

## üìÇ Dataset
The analysis uses the publicly available **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).

---

## üõ† Methodology
The analysis follows a structured statistical workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values  
   - Removing irrelevant columns  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizations and descriptive statistics  
   - Uncovering initial patterns and relationships  

3. **Inferential Statistics**  
   - Formal hypothesis tests (Two-Sample T-tests, Chi-Square Tests)  
   - Rigorous assumption checks to confirm significance

## üîë Key Findings
The analysis concluded that the following factors are **statistically significant drivers of employee attrition**:

- **Low Monthly Income** ‚Üí Employees who leave have a significantly lower monthly income on average than those who stay.  
- **Working Overtime** ‚Üí Strong association with attrition likelihood.  
- **Specific Job Roles** ‚Üí Roles like *Sales Representative* and *Laboratory Technician* have disproportionately high turnover rates.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Ensure you have **R** and **RStudio** installed.  
2. Place the file `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` in the same directory as the R script.  
3. Open the R script and **run it from top to bottom** to replicate the full analysis.
